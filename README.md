Designing  an auto-encoder to detect fraudulent transactions of credit card
Development Environment used- Conda 
Programming language - Python
Description - Fraud Detection through Autoencoders:
This endeavor focuses on using machine learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset's rarity of fraud cases among a large volume of transactions poses a challenge. Through PCA transformation, I preprocess the data, split it into subsets, and meticulously design an autoencoder model. Extracting encoder and decoder components, I gain insights into feature representation and generate outputs. Analyzing Mean Absolute Error histograms helps define a threshold for fraud detection. The project concludes by evaluating the autoencoder's accuracy in identifying non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions, contributing to secure financial transactions using AI.
